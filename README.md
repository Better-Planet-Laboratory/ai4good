# ai4good course
This repo is for the [Better Planet Laboratory's](https://betterplanetlab.com/) fun and approachable ai4good course. Care about poverty? Food security? Disaster response? Also passionate about data science and technology, including AI and machine learning? This hands-on course aims to familiarise you with a foundation for using state of the AI technologies, for practical, real-world use cases, focussed on sustainable development. Youâ€™ll have a chance to learn key APIs and apply what you learn to your own project. 

# Basic set up

The course set up is fairly simple. Each week we'll record a short video for you to watch. You can use this to learn about some basic concepts. We then invite you to join a group discussion (if you are following this at home, find a friend to work through the course with to test your ideas)

# Schedule 

Briefly the course will be set up with the following notebooks:

- Week 1: Setup in Kaggle, Image-Text-Text example
- Week 2: MLP and backprop
- Week 3: CNNs and Land Cover classification 
- Week 4: Embeddings, CF, Autoencoders and climate search.
- Week 5: Satellite foundation models, poverty prediction
- Week 6: GBMs and crop yield prediction
- Week 7: LLMs, sentiment analaysis, text meaning
- Week 8: Chatbot creation
For the following weeks:
- Weeks 9+ 10: Competitions/leaderboard stats [need to add data description notebooks]
- Week 11-16 = Project development [no notebooks]


# Resources

Here are some resources to help you along the way:

- Videos for each week can be found [here](https://o365coloradoedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/zime6804_colorado_edu/Em2KAs7zzOVMod6E-B7eirwBZ6UmLLTpclxCZTlOI26zSg?e=AV9xKY) (will be uploaded on youtube in due course..).

- Notebooks, each week new notebooks will be uploaded on this repo [here.](https://github.com/Better-Planet-Laboratory/ai4good/tree/main/Notebooks) We recommend setting yourself up with a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) account and importing each notebook, data and models for that week as you go.

- Weekly discussion points, updated each week [here](https://github.com/Better-Planet-Laboratory/ai4good/blob/main/resources/ai4good%20group%20discussion%20points.pptx), to ground test your knowledge.

- This course wouldn't be possible without a whole community of researchers and practitioners making their knowledge, code, and publically available. We have compiled some supplementary including online articles, videos, papers and more that might be helpful for you in learning more about ai. If you have a favorite, add it!

- We have a discord server set up [here](https://discord.gg/9Gw4pgpV). As we are testing of this course it is currently private, but the plan is to open it out later to the public if there is interest.

# Learning outcomes

Below are some of the high level learning outcomes from this course. 

-  Describe the major challenges facing sustainable development and the role that data science and machine learning can play in achieving these goals 
- Conceptually describe the key elements of statistical learning and some of key models and architectures of deep learning today 
- Be able to implement end-end pipelines for prediction using leading computer vision and NLP models using current frameworks
- Conduct independent data science research projects and apply conceptual understanding to practical implementation
- Demonstrate effective listening and discussion skills; and work through ideas and problems in a team (for those 

# For CU folks

For CU folks, we have set up a Canvas page for you which includes all of the assignments and grading and exact due dates for this course. In brief the grading is split 30% participation (turn up to sessions!), 30% notebook completion (work through notebooks and complete the tasks each week) and 40% for final project (present your project in the final week of class). A cool aspect of this course is that you will have the chance to work and be coached on a projects you are passionate about.  At the end, you'll publish your findings in a public [Medium ](https://medium.com/) post, which you'll link to your notebook/code. Check out this example [here](https://medium.com/fika-blog/waternet-ai-powered-global-water-mapping-triples-known-waterways-bc3095783661). You'll also present your findings in a 10min 7 page slide deck [a title slide, the innovation, methods, findings, 
optional findings 2, take homes]. Project submissions will be graded on four critera. Innovation (has it been done before?), Rigour (is it valid?), Potential impact (user targeting, theory of change) and Presentation (story, narrative, viz).

Also CU folks there are a number of required syllabus statements linked here
