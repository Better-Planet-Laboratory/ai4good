# ai4good
This repo is for the Better Planet Laboratory's ai4good course. Care about poverty? Food security? Disaster response? Also passionate about data science and technology, including AI and machine learning? This hands-on course aims to familiarise you with a foundation for using state of the AI technologies, for practical, real-world use cases, focussed on sustainable development. Youâ€™ll have a chance to learn key APIs and apply what you learn to your own project. 

# Basic set up

# Schedule 

Briefly the course will be set up with the following notebooks:

- Week 1: Setup in Kaggle, Image-Text-Text example
- Week 2: MLP and backprop
- Week 3: CNNs and Land Cover classification 
- Week 4: Embeddings, CF, Autoencoders and climate search.
- Week 5: Satellite foundation models, poverty prediction
- Week 6: GBMs and crop yield prediction
- Week 7: LLMs, sentiment analaysis, text meaning
- Week 8: Chatbot creation
For the following weeks:
- Weeks 9+ 10: Competitions/leaderboard stats [need to add data description notebooks]
- Week 11-16 = Project development [no notebooks]
