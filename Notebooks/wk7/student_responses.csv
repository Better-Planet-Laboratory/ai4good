student_2,"That quiz made me feel bad, I thought i was being environmentally sound but turns out no matter what you do youre still impacting the planet which in turn impacts someone else. An effective way to communicate this issue is making it more known, most people think driving an electric car is being super conscious but its still affecting the environment. We could educate more so we know wjhat to do to leave less of a footprint. "
student_3,"I did not think that was possible. Im upset that it said i took 16 hours off of someones life, and knowing that I have made similar decisions before, i wonder if i have already shortened a persons life. I think it was an effective way to tell people, very direct "
student_4,This quiz was a great reality check and I feel it very effectively communicates the effects of simple day-to-day choices on someone else. It showed that even the most irrelevant choices in our lives can have drastic impacts on our species. It was shocking to see that these 3 choices could have such a strong outcome on another individuals life. 
student_5,"I enjoyed this quiz, it showed how my decision to eat chickpeas was the best option, I am vegan and this was nice to see, I also noticed how plug in hybrid car is the 4th worst option, and this is my main mode of transportation, I hope I can help create better choices that help the environment  "
student_6,I was incredibly shocked that with just a few choices I could take 16 hours off someone’s life. It make me feel really sad because I frequently make some of these choices every day. I think making people more aware of these consequences seems really important.  
student_7,I did not realize how my actions had deeply impacted the lives of others. I did feel like it was a good way to communicate the issue at hand. I can start trying to use public transportation more and add more plant-based meals to my diet. 
student_8,"My results were ""Your choices took 16.72 hours off someone else's life due to negative impacts of climate change. This person likely resides in South Asia or Sub-Saharan Africa."" I was surprised at first by this, but than thought about it and am not that surprised. It made me feel sad and guilty and I think it is an effective way to communicate this issue and show people that even their simple actions are affecting others right now. Some people think that these choices will just be a problem for future generations, but it is a problem right now. It could be improved by adding more questions, or having a longer option for the quiz that incorporates more aspects. "
student_9,"It made me feel partially guilty. I think I could reduce my impact, however, I know that it is nearly impossible for me to get it down to 0 hours. I think an effective way to communicate the issue is by spreading awareness about the impact of small decisions people make such as food. For me, I think that I could improve my travel/transportation section of my impact. "
student_10,"This was very interesting to see a number attached to my choices, because normal that's not something I would think about. Makes me wonder what other choices I could make to be more sustainable. It conveyed its message effectively and simply, I would love to see a longer version. "
student_11,"I thought it was interesting how it shows how your actions are taking someone else's life away. It made me feel like, as a collective population, we are probably taking a lot of life away due to very avoidable lifestyle choices. It was an effective way to communicate this issue. I think it could give you an estimate of how much life 100 people like yourself are taking away. I think this could be more impactful. "
student_12,"Taking the quiz made me realize how dangerous some of the actions we have cause for pollution and these things happen everyday, multiple times a day. I think it is an effective way of communicating the problem as it is short and easy to consume, making people question their decisions. I think one way it could be improved is making a more detailed or longer version for more effects, or providing data to show the relationship between choosing certain options and the impacts that they have. "
student_13,My thoughts on this makes me feel bad about my decisions after finding out my decisions would change someone’s life. I think it was an effective way to communicate the issue because now I am aware how much one decision could harm someone else. I think I could change some of my decisions I make everyday in order to change someone else’s life. 
student_14,"The results from my answers made me realize some of the choices I usually make and the effects of them. The result of 16.79 hours made me feel worse, and seeing that the options I choose were towards the worse end didn't make me feel any better. I think this is a great way to get people to start thinking and understanding the effects their choices have. Adding new and more choices, also more questions on everyday decisions somebody may make could improve and further strengthen this topic.  "
student_15,"This made me feel uneasy about the simple choices I make especially with driving and flying. Yes, it was effective because it made me think and realize how important my everyday tasks are and how severely they can impact someone else's life. I could fly less often and only when it is not in a drivable area also I could use electric cars more.  "
student_16,"The quiz said I would take around 15 hours of off someone else' life based on my everyday choices which doesn't make me feel super amazing. I think this is a very interesting quiz, but the answer did make me feel troubled, and like I should try to make a change where I can to be more sustainable. An effective way to communicate this issue would be that we are always going to be taking advantage of others through what we buy, because they are producing it, which at a certain point is just the way the economy is going to work, but we can still try to limit the amount of taxing labor we place on others if we can help it. I think improving that awareness would lead to a better result on this quiz.  "
student_17,Food: Chicken breast is the 3rd best optionTransport: Petrol Car is the worst optionFlight: New York-San Francisco is the 3rd best optionYour choices took 14.05 hours off someone else's life due to negative impacts of climate change. This person likely resides in South Asia or Sub-Saharan Africa. 
student_21,"It made me feel bad in very simple terms. I think this could be an effective way to communicate this issue because it makes you personally feel very responsible and therefore more likely to take action. Still, I think the quiz should be a little more detailed when it comes to asking questions. Impact is much more nuanced and complicated.  "
student_22,It was kind of interesting and shocking how much my choices impacted other people's lives. I think this was an effective way to communicate this issue as it is shocking information and really opens your eyes to how much your life impacts the lives of others. I'm not sure what else could be improved as there is already enough information and it does a good job of displaying the information.  
student_23,"It is a very eye-opening experience. Very interesting idea that applies to everyone and lets them see the effect of their choices It is something I don't think about daily, so it did have a shocking effect on me  Providing this quiz to as many people as possible through different sources is the best way to communicate it. Maybe a social media campaign, where you ask random people on campus those 3 questions and filming their reaction to the results would be a good idea.  I think its good as is, short enough for people to take it, and relatable to everyone  "
student_24,I've done tests like this before but I've never gotten my results back as time someone else spent to make this happen. It makes me feel kind of down that someone spends that much time on something for me to enjoy it a fourth of the time. The most effective way to communicate this issue is to get it into the main stream media around the world so more people see and to have influential people talk about it. I think the best way things could be improved is both technological advancements and making these advancements more easily accessible so people don't spend as much time working for these things. 
student_25,I took off 7.67 hours off someone's life. Compared to the girls around who took 30 I feel good.  
student_26,"I think that it was a great way to communicate the issue.  I found out my score and it told me how I should change my habits.  I believe this is what people need.  Nothing could be improved with the quiz, it was great. "
student_27,"The quiz is a bit simple, and the idea of what connection you would take needs to be more relative. I chose to fly from New York to London because this is the only flight that made sense for me to do, as I live in the United States and do not see myself doing any other flight. I do not think it is too effective for me personally as it does not show the weight of my different choices as to what is more detrimental to the environment, such as my flight or eating tuna. I think showing how each choice individually affects the livelihood of other people makes a lot more sense.  "
student_28,"Taking 17 hours off someones life is a very frightening thought, but to be honest, I'm not sure I would change my actions.An effective way to communicate these things would be showing people these stats, but more importantly show them how everyone else would change and find a way to get everyone to commit. Too many people will say ""well X person isn't doing this, so I wont make a difference"" or ""the flight will takeoff anyways"" Find a way to have EVERYONE buy in!! "
student_29,"It was interesting, I do think it was an effective way to communicate the issue. The statistics and the wording worked really well. I think there could be maybe a couple more questions.  "
student_30,I feel like I could be more thoughtful and aware. I think it is. Nothing. 
student_31,"I believe it is quite interesting that my decisions directly affect the hours of someone else's life. It made me feel guilty, especially for using a car for transportation when that is the worst option of transportation. I believe a good way to communicate this issue is to see how your individual choices affect another person's life as this quick quiz did. I believe there could be more options or choices.  "
student_32,"After completing the quiz, I feel bad about the choices I make every day. I believe it is an effective way because it gives the reader a thought on how their everyday choices affect other people's lives. I feel that there could be a greater amount of questions that could improve this quiz in giving a more definitive answer or estimate. "
student_33,I feel as though we can improve the amount of electric cars there are in the world. They do not emit toxic chemicals to the atmosphere.  
student_34,This made me feel honestly horrible- many of my choices were in the better half of choices(they caused less negative impact than others) I try to be sustainable and i do think about the ways in which my actions impact the environment but I think that looking at it in direct correlation with how it shortens the lifespan and quality of life on individuals really make the gravity of the situation feel so much stronger. I think this was an incredibly effective and impactful way to communicate this and i think that my own actions could be improved by keeping this mindset at the forefront of my mind in my day to day lif e 
student_35,"I was honestly surprised because i thought i was pretty kowledgable on what lifestyle choices are most sustainable. Fish is a better protein than beef, but still not as good as a plant based alternative. I assumed a bus would be the best option but idk what the best was. and the flight was kinda random. despite knowing this i decreased a person in a developing countries life by almost 2 days. I think its weird that such normal choices are so bad for the world. "
student_37,"I thought the quiz was very interesting. I chose eggs which was the second best option, which made me feel good about myself, but for the next question I chose a gas powered car, which was the worst option. This made me feel like I am single handedly contributing to climate change by driving my car. Since moving to Boulder, I have been walking a lot more and driving less, which has made me feel like I am helping the environment more. My knee jerk reaction being to drive an unsustainable vehicle reflects how in our society, we want to travel places as quickly as possible, with disregard to our environment. I think this quiz needs to be more widespread, to show people that even small choices, like what you want to eat, greatly affect our environment. "
student_38,It definetly makes me feel more personalized with my experience in how i affect the enviorment and people around me 
student_39,"I chose lamb, petrol car, and Capetown-Amsterdam. I took 32.07 hours off someone's life. This made me surprised as I didn't know that some of these could impact someone's life so significantly. I think it was an effective way to communicate this issue as it was shocking. I think explaining why and how it impacts a person's life span would help to improve it.  "
student_40,I didnt expect my choices to be so harmful. It made me rethink the other ways that I could be negatively impacting some elses life. One thing that could be improved is informing people of the impact that their decisions have on the environment and others. 
student_41,"It made me more aware of my actions and how negatively it affected other people. This is a very effective way to make more people aware of their actions. I really like that it was short but very impactful once you learn how many hours. Personally, I don't think this can be improved. "
student_42,"It surprised me, I thought that the decisions I made were not very harmful, choosing chicken instead of red meat, and a train instead of a car, but they still very negatively impacted someone else's life.  "
student_43,"Not great, it made me feel more motivated to make better choices. Spread awareness about everyday choices that make environmental impacts. Transportation can be improved and more sustainable food options. "
student_44,It said I would take 16.32 hours off someone's life who likely lives in South Asia or Africa.  I think this was touching and an effective way to communicate this issue because it directly connected my actions and choices to someone's life.  I think what could be improved is more questions because there are other choices we make in our day-to day lives that could have similar impacts on other people around the world.   
student_45,"I think that this is a good way to put someones choices into perspective. This made me feel regretful of my decisions and upset with the current state of the world. Yes this was an effective and simple way to communicate this issue. This could be improved by adding other factors such as where you live, how much you waste and other factors that impact the environment.  "
student_46,It makes you realize how much transport our goods through just to get to the consumer. It is so difficult to live a sustainable life in the modern American world and it is honestly quite depressing. It makes me think about my choices more and how small choices genuinely do make an impact on the world.  An effective way to communicate this issue would be discouraging the advertisement of commercial flights and imported food as luxuries. Living humbly should be romanticized more rather than consuming as much as you possibly can.  Local foods and public transport are issues i think America needs to improve greatly upon.   
student_47,"I thought I did pretty well, considering my choices were 2nd, 4th, and 3rd best options on the respected list. I think it was an effective way to communicate this issue because it allows people to consider the options that they make in real life, giving it a more personal meaning.  "
student_48,It made me feel much more aware of my actions and their impacts on other people. This was a very effective way to communicate this issue because nobody knows their impact until they choose choices they would normally and see the exact impact on another's life. I think there could be an improvement on what choices would cause a different impact.  
student_49,"Food: Chicken breast is the 3rd best optionTransport: Domestic Flight is the 2nd worst optionFlight: Sydney-Singapore is the 4th worst optionYour choices took 17.04 hours off someone else's life due to the negative impacts of climate change. This person likely resides in South Asia or Sub-Saharan Africa.I think this is what I have to do. I think the fact that my actions take 17 hours off someone's life is simply not true, and based on very broad generalized statistics. I think this is the reason why I always find myself disenfranchised by the green movement. Even though I care, stuff like this, which is so hyperbolic, meant to just guilt me, and isn't even very true, makes me care even less. Ultimately I have to make the decisions I make, I'm from Singapore, and I have to fly there, I can't spend 2 months on a sailboat going across the Pacific. This sort of rhetoric and guilt-tripping is why, 90% of people pretend to care about the environment for optics but don't actually help the environment in any way, and why people in general make choices that seem green but are ultimately not. This is all about perception and never about the realities. "
student_50,How did it make you feel? It was strange to see a tangible number to my impact and also the accusation made me feel kind of bad. Was it an effective way to communicate this issue? I think the quiz was effective. What could be improved? It would be interesting to see a map of where I am more likely to impact. 
student_51,The results of the quiz honestly made me feel guilty more than anything because it's scary to realize that you have such a big impact on other peoples lives with silly things you wouldn't give two thoughts about. This is definitely an effective way to communicate the issue because it makes you personally think about your choices and shows you statistically its effects. I would improve my transportation for sure because seeing that that was the worst option made me feel super guilty and want to make some changes in my day to day. 
student_52,"My results took off 14.03 hours off of somebody's life. This is definitely shocking, as I feel like my answers aligned relatively with the average person. I think this was definitely an effective way to communicate this issue, as it puts into perspective how your choices may affect others. I think along with these results, it could have gone into detail about how each choice you make affects this statistic. "
student_53,It feels very strange to have the environmental impact of my choices measured in hours taken off of somebody else's life. It makes me want to reconsider some of my lifestyle choices to be a little more sustainable if possible. This did feel like a pretty effective way to communicate the idea of the consequences of our actions on others and the environment. The flight section could maybe be improved by asking what the longest flight the person taking the quiz has ever been on to give a more direct reflection of their environmental impact. 
student_54,It made me feel sad because of the choices I made it cost someone 17 hours of there own life. An effective way to communicate this issue is to communicate the importance of the different issues that each person makes. What could be improved is to make better eating choices and travel in a better way to lessen our impact on the globe.    
student_55,I liked this survey I found it interesting that little choices in everyday life effect other peoples life in ways.  Yes I thought it was a fast effect way to communicate this issue.  
student_56,It made me feel more conscientious about the choices I make. I don't want others to suffer because of my selfishness. It was an effective way to communicate. I think the thing that could be improved is the question about the international flight is not clear. 
student_58,I was shocked to see the result of the quiz. Putting it into the hours that i would be taking off of someone elses life put the environmental impact I have into perspective. My result was 13 hours off of someone else's life. This was a very effective way to communicate the impact. I think it could be improved by asking more questions. 
student_59,"Doing the survey on the link made me realize how much everything and all of your choices have an impact on our environment and climate change. I think this was an effective way to show people that everything has an effect on the environment, but I do wish to learn more about what decisions are the most environmentally friendly. I think that the only improvement I would make is having short texts explaining the reason for the rankings and the way they are being ranked. Overall, it was good to know!  "
student_61,"Thankfully, I didn't pick the worst options. It was sad to see those choices make such an impact. I'm unsure how I could live a life free of any harmful impact.  "
student_62,"How did it make you feel? - This was a shock to see, I didn't know that the stats of climate change could be linked to someone's life, especially the time that it would take off. Was it an effective way to communicate this issue? - Yes, this is a very effective way to communicate the issue as it plays on human emotion. What could be improved? - More questions, modeling something like the carbon footprint calculator, would make this quiz much better as it would be able to show a larger number. "
student_63,"I definitely think it is an effective way to communicate the issue. It honestly just surprised me but a lot of things they're asking about aren't things most people have an option to change. For example, the car you drive. A lot of people transport in the ways they can afford. Not everyone can afford a nice hybrid or electric car. As far as improvement goes we need to shift back to a vegetable diet. The widespread availability of meat is excessive and unnecessary. There are plenty of ways to get a healthy amount of protein from plants. "
student_64,1. I think it makes you realize how much we transport our goods just to get into the hands of the consumer. It shows that you are always getting it from a bigger source then what it may seem.  2. An effective way to communicate this issue would be to make people more aware of the situation at hand because some companies like to hide this from the consumer.  3. A way they could improve this could be is to promote more local food sources and move away from the public transport.  
student_65,"This quiz was powerful, it made me feel bad about making such a simple choice, like what protein I want to add to my meal. This was a very quick, effective way to communicate this issue, I think its very well done  "
student_66,"After utilizing the calculator, I've found out that my decisions take 16.6 hours off of somebody's life. While that's not even a full day, it really opens my eyes up to the fact that every single decision I make has an impact on the environment, and that if myself and others don't make better decisions reguarding sustainability, all of our lifespan's will be impacted greatly. This was a very effective way to communicate this issue because it honestly evokes a lot of guilt about the decisions that I make on a day to day basis. All I can say is wow.  "
student_67,"The quiz made me think about the choices I make on the daily that would just be second hand to me usually. I think it was an effective way to communicate the issue because by creating something interactive they were able to engage their audience better. I think they could improve by taking different peoples lifestyles into account, maybe you choose the type of place you live in before you take the quiz to make it more personal.  "
student_68,"It was an interesitng quiz, and it put into perspective the direct impacts that my choices have on others and the world. I didn't feel too much, mostly because I didn't see how my impact also affects me. An effective way to communicate this information is through education.  "
student_69,"This quiz made me realized that i should be more careful with a i consume on a day to day basis and the effective ways i could use to sustain my meal plans and transportation ways, i really love the website. "
student_70,"I took 14.53 hours off of someone else's life. This quiz was very eye-opening, and I am surprised that the options that I chose were as poor as they were. I think this was an effective way to communicate and more people should take this quiz. Make the quiz longer and allow more options.  "
student_71,"I am very confused how prawns was the third worst food option. It made me sad knowing that my life is taking away from someone else's. Yes, I believe this was a good way to communicate this issue since it shows me that I am causing a detriment to someone else's life. I need to make sure I track what I am doing so I cause less harm to the environment. "
student_72,"This activity really surprised me because I didn't realize the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from food, especially chicken and steak. It made me feel guilty because even though I thought I was aware of this, my day to day life takes away time from the lives of others. Yes this is effective because it tells you the hard truth and you can't argue with facts (16.72 hours opened my eyes up). I think it can be improved a little, only because it can inaccurate if people haven't traveled internationally.  "
student_73,I thought this was a very effective way at portraying the world because who would've thought that such small decisions I make could take a couple days off someone's life. Id like to see more options because we could get a real grasp on our total impact. 
student_74,"it makes you feel like an asshole, and makes you rethink your actions and what you could have done differently to reduce your burdens  it was a good way of showing the message through innocent questions  more questions would be better "
student_75,"This made me feel that what you eat, drive, and where you fly to can effect on someone life and how long they live. Yes it was because it shows that if you drive a petrol car you have a big effect one someone because of that and same with what you eat. What could be improved is what food you eat, what transportation you take and where you flight could be improved to help the world "
student_76,I think that it made me feel sad. I think it was an affective way to communicate the importance of the issues each person produces. I think i could improve about every decision i chose because they were all one of the worst possible options i could choose. 
student_77,I didn't realize how much my actions impacted other people. I think it was pretty effective at communicating the issue. The second question was confusing. 
student_78,"It made me feel bad since I took 13 hours off of someone else's life. Yes, I do think this is quite an effect way to communicate this issue since it says where you took some else's life. I think that I could improve on the choses I make on a day to day basis to become more sustainable and environmentally conscious.  "
student_80,It makes me feel upset that many of my life choices negatively impact the environment so severely. I will choose better forms of travel and research the food I am eating and its impacts on the environment. I think that making it known how horrible certain choices can be is the most beneficial thing to do.  
student_81,How did it make you feel? It made me sad that my choices are impacting others lives. Was it an effective way to communicate this issue? Yes definitely I think this is a good reality check for people to notice on their lives. What could be improved? Maybe just expanding the options. 
student_82,"Knowing the estimated impact that my choices have on another person's life really emphasized the importance of considering environmental impact when making decisions.    It was an effective way to communicate, as often when we make these choices we have no idea what impact it has.  This way, I can see how choices I make nearly every day are actively impacting them. Education regarding how these choices impact people indirectly would, in my opinion, make people much less likely to choose the more harmful options. "
student_83, Give your thoughts on this. How did it make you feel? Was it an effective way to communicate this issue? What could be improved? Made me think and opened my eyes to how powerful and important climate change and our resources are  
student_84,"It made me feel like I don't do enough in my life to help contribute to the slow of climate change, but I also feel as though I can't do much more due to financial issues. I thought it was pretty effective, since it tells you how much impact you cause. Improvements could be suggestions on ways to reduce your impact while still keeping to a budget and following your personal choices.  "
student_85,it made me feel sad knowing that everything I do has an impact on someone life. Travel could be improved the most in my opinion that has the biggest effect on people's lives. I think the quiz was a very effective way to communicate this issue as well as making sure everyone understands the things they do all have impacts on others.  
student_86,"This made me feel the weight of my decisions more. I never really thought about how choosing to have a certain food at a meal would take time off of someone's life. This is a good way to communicate this issue, giving a specific amount of time you took off someone's life. This could be improved by adding in more factors, and also by explaining how exactly the decisions directly affect other people. "
student_87,The quiz made me feel guilty for making decisions in my everyday life that have big impacts on others that I can't even comprehend. An effective way to communicate this issue is through education about our individual impact. Improvements could be made in the amount of sustainable options available to modern populations in public transportation and food options.  
student_88,This made me feel bad about my everyday choices that they could have such a direct impact on someone else's life. I think it effectively made me see that everyday things have a huge environmental impact however it didn't raise good alternatives. 
student_89,This quiz made me feel a little guilty. The results saying that you are taking time off of someone else's life puts it into perspective. Sometimes it is easy to forget that every choice you make has an impact.  This is an effective way because it shows you the impact and also shows the other better choices that could be made on each step.  I don't know what could be improved. Maybe adding some sort of way to go on after the quiz and learn more about how to have a smaller impact wherever you are in the world.  
student_90,"This activity made me feel pretty bad about my choices. I think knowing this is a very good thing, because I will now think about this before I choose if I am going to eat cheese, or travel to Austrailia. I think this is because it using the technique of pathos that taps into guilt that my choices are harming other people. Guilt is a good way to create change. It could be a fuller quiz with more questions and I would have taken it to know more. "
student_91,It makes sense that there are different impacts on your decisions. It doesn't make me feel bad but it shows a different perspective about the decisions you make in your life. I think its an effective way to communicate the idea but it doesn't have the greatest effect. I don't know what could be improved.  
student_92,How did it make you feel? This made me feel fortunate and also confused. Was it an effective way to communicate this issue? It was mostly effective but I would like to know exactly how I'm taking time off of someone else's life. What could be improved? Specific reasons that calculate the time given and also how different choices impact the time. 
student_93,"I found the results of the quiz to be very interesting. It made me feel a bit guilty that my options in life would negate the livelihood of someone else's, but I am also aware that it is not a huge difference. I think it is more of the concept of ""taking hours off of a life"" that affected me. I think taking away the concept of guilt would improve this communication of the issue. "
student_95,"The way that the results of this assignment were phrased was really unsettling, but important to see. Seeing that something I do can impact someone else's life due to climate change was eye opening, as it is usually never put into the terms of how it impacts people. "
student_96,"The quiz that was given really put into perspective what impact my small choices in life have on other people and the environment. I believe that this is a quick and easy way to really communicate the issue, since these are choices people make all the time every day. The only thing that could be improved would be to give more answer choices to questions. "
student_97,"This activity actually gives some good perspective on the everyday choices you make. It is definitely saddening that others are this heavily impacted based off our every day choices as well. I think the most effective way to communicate this issue is through publicizing it, making it well known information. There definitely could be a fuller picture as well to improve this, having more background information. "
student_98,"I was shown to take 14.5 hours off of someone's life and it made me rethink the everyday actions that I choose to follow through with. I need to be more mindful about how and when to drive more mindfully. Making sure that I can carpool, be more careful about what I eat, and choose travel trips wisely etc. Knowing how meat effects the environment already I have tried to implement days out of the week where I eat plant based, and also without a car in boulder it is easy to walk to wherever I need to go. An effective way to communicate this issue is to inform other people about how much they are taking off of someone else's life and hopefully they understand and follow their leads. This can be improved by showing people to do the better option. "
student_99,"1. I was trying to be honest with my answers and my choices took 13.43 hours off someone's life. 2. It made me feel somewhere in between, good because I answered accurately and honestly but bad because of the negative impact of my choices.  3. I think it is a good way to show how our decisions, whether selfish or not always have an impact.  4. I think it doesnt need to be improved it gave good choices to choose from. If anything maybe have an option for not applicable in the flight section since not everyone has the means to travel.  "
student_100,This quiz made me think differently about my environmental impact. It said with my choices I would take 16.67 hours off someone else's life due to negative impacts of climate change. It is important that we know how we can decrease our environmental impacts with transportation and our food choices. We can communicate this issue by advertising and allowing more people to take this quiz. We need new strategies to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impacts.  
student_101,"I didn't know that my lifestyle choices had that much of an effect on the environment. It made me feel like I need to be more conscious of what I do and how it affects others. Yes, it showed how much people can affect the environment, even if they are trying not to. It could be improved by showing which areas are affected the most and who.  "
student_102,Give your thoughts on this. I find it very interesting how it gives the time 'taken' off someones life because of my impact.  How did it make you feel? It makes me feel a bit more conscious of my impact and what I should do better to help the environment and ourselves.  Was it an effective way to communicate this issue? I do not think it was an effective way to communicate this issue because environmental impacts do not directly correlate to human live.  What could be improved? A different correlation.  
student_103,I was shocked at how much 3 simple choices can affect climate change and ultimately take away as many as 300 hours away from someone's life. An effective way to communicate this issue would be through the mass distribution of a survey like this. Not enough people know about the critical effect making simple everyday life decisions can have on those who live in less developed countries more susceptible to climate change. I think there is a huge problem with the amount of emissions planes give off. We're on route to fixing the problem with automobiles. Our next step is to find more sustainable ways of flying. 
student_104,"It's shocking and slightly humbling, but I think it is an effective way to show us how much we have an impact as an individual. I think safer public transportation and more education on the topic would help. "
student_105,I thought this was really interesting to see. It was weird to see how many hours I would take off of someone's life due to my choices and I've never thought about it that way before. It was effective I think because it made me think about the choices I made and how I could've chosen more sustainable practices. Something that could be improved is more choices to choose from or maybe longer to make more decisions and think about them. 
student_106,This quiz was interesting to me. I think that it maybe estimates the time off of someones life too easily and off of too little factors. I did however pick the worst options or close to the worst options in every category which i did not realize had that big of an impact. I think that the results were a bit shocking and it was an effective way to communicate the issue. The only way i could improve it is to add a description of your choices and why they are the worst when you get your results. 
student_107,"I took 38.6 hours off of someone else's life. That made me feel horrible, actually, and I need to make some lifestyle change. This was a very effective way to communicate this because it very starkly shows you the consequences on someone else's life. I would add a graph showing how each option effects and what choices we can make to improve.  "
student_108,"I was surprised that those choices took 32 hours of someone's life. I was being truthful and not trying to choose sustainable options, but I feel like I could make way better choices that would have a better impact on me and consequently on others. That quiz is an effective way to communicate the issue since it gives you a dire response and shows you the direct impact on your choices. I think my choices of travel and protein could be improved, although the flights I can't really help unless I didn't need to go there. "
student_109,"1. Its very shocking to see how my actions could be effecting others especially those in less developed countries. 2.It makes me feel very privileged and selfish. 3. yes, this quiz communicated its message well. 4. The quiz could be more personable. the questions they asked didn't give me the answers i wanted   "
student_110,This quiz made me realize how my decisions impact others greatly. I think that it was effective but needs to be more effective. This is a problem that must be discussed more than it is. I think that knowing the problems you can cause will improve our decisions 
student_111,"This didn't really make me feel anything. I don't believe it's effective because it doesn't tell you anything about why your choices have the impact they have, what you could do better, how other people's choices are impacting the issue, and how much would change if you improved. "
student_112,The quiz was intriguing but the results page only shows the hours of impact your answers had and doesn't show the possible outcomes from other answer choices. This could better educate people on which choices are sustainable and which choices are not. 
student_113,"It puts in perspective the choices we make everyday and how they affect the environment and others. At the end when it said ""my decisions"" took 16.3 hours off of someones life it made it much more personal. It makes you stop and think about what alternatives are available and how they may affect the people who suffer most. "
student_114,"Its an amazing website as it gives you a perspective that you have never seen or experienced before, it made me feel more concern and thoughtful of my choices as there is a correlation to the choices i make and other peoples lives that id be affecting, Its a really effective way to communicate this issue as the questions are pretty simple daily questions that i never thought would effect anyone negatively. improvements could be by explaining why and how the choices i make affect  others negatively, for example why steak beef was the worst option, how does it effect people? "
student_115,"I like the point of yes there is awareness, but just because you know about something, why will you care...  What I like about this is that it makes climate change much more personable.  Something that we discussed in my last recitation was that when someone dies we will attribute the death to the direct cause like cancer... We never say the cause of death was the environmental factors that played into a person getting cancer. I think this reframing of how we talk about environmental health can help you communicate the issue you are addressing.  "
student_116,"I think that I have a large ecological footprint and that in the future, I need to do things to save energy and minimize my impact. It makes me feel a little bit shocked to see how much I impact other people. I think that it was an effective way to communicate this issue.  "
student_117,"At the end of my submission, it said that my choices took 16.4 hours off of someone’s life, most likely in East Asia. This definitely makes me feel bad, and knowing this now I would try and change my choices if I knew what was more sustainable. I think that this was an effective way to relay this issue but it also didn’t go into detail on how those things cause that outcome. How does eating chicken as my first choice and taking transportation cause someone to die 16.4 house prior? I think that after revealing this info, it would be helpful if there was a why. "
student_118,"Clearly after seeing the typed of affects that my everyday choices have on many other people's lives are very impactful. Making it knows to almost all students could be a great way of spreading this awareness, and to improve it we all have to do our best to make better choices in terms of what we eat and what we use to travel etc.  "
student_119,I really liked this quiz. It was straightforward and to the point and easy to navigate. It made me realize how severe my actions are and that even though I don't think about it my actions do affect others. I think an effective way to communicate this issue is make it so people realize the consequences of their actions. Before this I had no idea that I affect others this much. I think the quiz was great and doesn't need to be improved. 
student_120,"For food I chose eggs, for transportation i chose plug in hybrid, and for the flight I chose Capetown to Amsterdam. I was so taken back by my results beacuse it was 31.57 hours taken off of someone else’s life. I am vegetarian so I know im more sustainable than others but clearly I make up for it in other areas. This was an effective way to communicate this issue beacuse this is someone’s life. I will continue to take public trsnapsotation. "
student_121,This quiz made me a little bad about my choices. An effective way to communicate this issue is by being more mindful about certain decisions that impact the environment. My decisions could be improved.  
student_122,"It made me feel a little guilty for the life of someone else. It was effective, although a more comprehensive test talking about more factors would be good. "
student_123,"Give your thoughts on this. I think it's interesting to see how even minor choices in one's lifer can impact the environment so much. Even things like food choice. How did it make you feel? It makes me feel worries for the choices I make, It makes me want to make sure all the choices I make are as sustainable as tehy can be, even if it's not a directly effected thing. Was it an effective way to communicate this issue? I think it's very effective in communicating the problem with these small decisions that people don't think about and their impacts What could be improved? Maybe a couple more questions to hammer the point home. "
student_124,"This definitely made me think more about the impact of each of my descisions on the worl around me. I think that was a good way to illustrate this point, as it is only three minor decisions that could reasonable occur in a weekend, yet it took about the same time off of someone’s life. Especially as you are told what region it affects. I think that we need to improve mass transportation, making it greener and cleaner, as everything needs to be transported, and making that greener will cut a lot of emissions and the impact. "
student_125,It makes me think more about my decisions and how much it is impacting other people lives in a negative way. I think just thinking more about everything I do because just because I am able to do it doesnt mean that it is good for the enviroment or for someones life.  
student_127,"It made me feel really guilty, especially the way that it was worded. Especially regarding the fact that it told me not only that my choices took hours off of someone else's life, but that they told me that it was from a part of the world much less affluent then where I am from. I think it needs to be more well known to everyone the impact that their decisions make one everyone around them, in order to have people need to make better decisions. "
student_128,"This was upsetting for me to see and was a bit shocking. I did not expect for my impact to be so great (16.4 hours off someone's life). I do think this is an effective way to communicate the issue, but I do not think it is a way for actual change to be made. People can see these stats but they don't have the actual tools to make change. I think real life ways to improve your score would be helpful! Like for the plan one or the traveling the far distance that is too far to walk or bike to there aren't really other options other than take a petrol car or have a connecting flight. So, this can make it hard for people to change their ways.  "
student_129,This quiz made me feel a bit bad because for 2 of the answers I chose the worst option possible and probably would not change my answers. I think that an effective way to communicate this issue is to post this quiz in the mainstream media so that more people could take it and see how much damage they are causing to the environment. I think that finding more sustainable ways to carry out everyday tasks would be a way to improve how we treat our environment. 
student_130,"I feel that it does make you stop and rethink your decisions. It doesn't make me feel the best about my lifestyle. I don't think it is a somewhat good way of communicating the issue, but I would have never known about this unless I had shared it.  The dispersion of the issue needs to be more widespread and communicating it in this way makes it nearly impossible for a majority of people to know about the issue due to the style of communication.  "
student_132,Interesting way of showing our impact on other people. This made me fell like shit. I don't know I'm not a phycologist. I don't know for the same reason. 
student_133,"It made me feel really guilty that my decisions can take 31 hours off of another persons life, BUT I do not feel like it is justified to put the blame on me or any average person. It is effective in communicating the issue, it shows that environmental impacts can affect human populations, but it puts the blame on us when in reality it is much harder for one single person to change their answers, when this is the global system provided to us. Yes, perhaps taking a long flight or eating chicken breast will damage the environment and another person, but what about the 2000 flights coming out of every single international airport in the world? Isn't THAT taking millions of hours off of people's lives? The test is effective in showing environmental damage but I wish it didn't target the consumer when there should be major changes at government/global system/IGO level.  "
student_134,My answers said my decision would take 6.64 hours off someone else's life. I think this is an effective way to show the impacts your choices have because you see how they are potentially affecting innocent people. I could improve by making decisions that have less of an environmental impact.  
student_135,I think this quiz is eye-opening on how such little one-time decisions can effect one's whole life. It made me realize how much more I could be doing to save the environment. I think an effective way to communicate this issue is to remind people every single time they are faced with a decision that could take time off someone's life. I think this could be improved by the public being educated on the decisions they are making and the impact it has on the numerous factors of the environment. 
student_136,"I think the quiz puts my lifestyle choices into perspectives. My results were 16.24 hours off of someone else's life most likely in sub-saharan Africa or south Asia. It made me feel depressed honestly knowing the cost of my resource demand impacts someone else's life that insanely much. An effective way to communicate this issue would be to find a new way to enjoy those parts of life that I was offered the choice in, and finding a more sustainable way to upkeep other people in other lower-income countries so they don't have to pay for higher-income resource demands.  "
student_137,"It made me curious how picking chicken, driving a distance unworkable, and taking a flight I don't take, took 38.8 hours off someone's life. Also, hearing that you took hours off someone's life also makes you feel a little guilty.    This is an effective way because it makes you stop and think about your consumption and how it actually affects someone's life.  Quiz was great! Short, informative, and got to the point.  "
student_138,"not very suprised that steak is the worst choice, trains make sense as a good mode of transport. I'm not sure guilt shaming people is the way to go to convince people to change "
student_139,"This surprised me a lot knowing how much small decisions impact others. It made me feel very uneducated, that when I make these decisions someone else can be harmed. What could be improved is getting myself more educated on my own actions. I think this was a good exercise because it makes us aware of the impact of human careless actions.  "
student_140,"I think that this quiz is a good way to find perspective on how other parts of the world are affected by someone's actions. Everything on Earth is really connected and it made me feel shocked. I think it is an effected way to communicate this issue because it's something that everyone can understand. They are easy questions with quick results that a lot of people can understand. For how quick and to the point the quiz was, I don't think there was much to be improved. It had a good point that is impactful to a large majority of people.  "
student_141,"It was actually shocking. I know that my lifestyle as an American directly impacts other people and our climate as a whole, but it was crazy to think that I am directly limiting someone's life through mt own. It was very effective, I just wanted to see what the best choices were afterwards. "
student_142,"The quiz made me feel like my footprint is excessively taxing on the environment and life on Earth in general. This is an effective way to communicate this issue because the notion of taking hours away from other humans' lives resonates with me deeply, as there is an emotional connection to my peers, making this quiz a brutally effective way to open my eyes to this problem. I can improve my daily conscious decisions such as what I eat and how I transport. "
student_143,"my results: Food: Tuna is the 4th best optionTransport: Train is the 3rd best optionFlight: London-New York is the 4th best optionYour choices took 16.2 hours off someone else's life due to negative impacts of climate change. This person likely resides in South Asia or Sub-Saharan Africa. How did it make you feel? This made me feel very weird, as it is not something you are often directly told- it is scary to think about how such a small decision, like the food i choose to eat at dinner, could take time away from someone else's life. It definitely made me more aware of the impact of those small decisions that many think are insignificant.  Was it an effective way to communicate this issue? Yes, very, mostly because it is intimidating and scary to think about. it makes you feel person guilt for your lifestyle, and makes you want to change things about your choices.  What could be improved? By explaining more thoroughly exactly how it is taking time off of this persons life.  "
student_145,"this was definitely shocking to see, I do question how accurate this survey really is, I don't understand why the correlation of if I eat chickpeas or cheddar cheese would cause someone to have a shorter life but if it is true, yes It does give me incentive to change my lifestyle choices a bit.  "
student_146,It made me feel bad because its very easy to choose these options without thinking about the impact of them. I think it was an effective way to communicate the issue because it puts your choices into perspective. I think the amount of travel and way of travel could be improved.  
student_147,I think it is crazy surpassing how those choices can change others lives so significantly.  I think it is an effective way to communicate this issue as it is such a massive issue on the globe. I think one thing that could be improved is add a few more questions to make the hours more accurate. 
student_148,"How did it make you feel? This activity made me realize how my choices impact others around the world who don't have enough to survive or are in poverty. It made me sad that I can't do much because of our global problem.  Was it an effective way to communicate this issue? It invokes a decent amount of guilt, so yes, even though I think that isn't always the best strategy for persuasion and action.  What could be improved? I think it could go more into diet info, your daily action, and views. It is just three questions and more would be helpful.  "
student_149,"I think it is very interesting that my life choices would have that significant of an impact on someone else's life. It made me feel somewhat guilty that I am passively having a negative impact on someone's life. Yes, it is interesting to see what 3 small actions could do to someone. I could make better actions to prevent impacting someone else. "
student_150,"I really liked how effective it was because it opened up my eyes to how much a gas car can effect the environment, even though I am only one person, my footprint can still be very large. It made me feel that I should change my habits and choose different options now that I know the impact directly. I think the quiz shows pathos which is very strong.  "
student_151,"I think that the way the results are shown as using hours off of someone's life and then attributing to the place they live is a good, but aggressive way to show the impact. I think it drove the meaning of the quiz harder than something else would. I think it is an effective way for the most part but some people will see it who are in a situation where they cant change things such as how to navigate 100km could be filled with guilt making it harsh on some.  "
student_152,"My results made me feel like I want to do better for the rest of the world. I chose to use a car which was the worst option, in college its easier to walk and bike but I want to implement this more when I go back home and have access to my car. This was a very effective way to convey the issue.  "
student_153,I didn't realize how much impact such small things could have on other peoples lives. I feel like guilty about my choices and how they could effect others. I think this little quiz was a very effective way to show how small things have a big impact. I think one way to improve this issue would be more education about how much impact different resources have on the environment.  
student_154,"It is very shocking learning about this, I didn't know that everyday decisions could have a large impact on someone's life. This makes me feel more inclined to make better decisions for my environment. In this way of how i learned i am a bit confused on how these few decisions can take away from someone else's life, but i do get it in a way of environmental impact can affect lower class countries. But it still gives me an incentive to change my lifestyle choices.  "
student_155,"This quiz made produced a wave of anxiety that my choices have such a negative impact on someone's life. It is effective in making the problem known, but I don't think that making people feel bad about their decisions is the best way to communicate problems. It can be improved by providing the information differently than hours off of someone's life.  "
student_156,After taking the quiz it made me realize how many of my daily choices can lower someone's life span by hours at a time. Because of this I will be more conscious of the decision I make and how they can affect other people. I think the human calculator is a great way to communicate how personal carbon emissions can affect someone else's life. I think it could be improved by having more options to choice from and overall be a longer quiz with more questions so it can relate to more people. 
student_157,"I thought it was an interesting quiz, but I would like to learn a bit more about the flight connection question! I understand emissions but maybe if there’s more to it, i’d like to know.   My initial reaction was, “that was an aggressive way of showing my impact” saying how many hours i’ve taken from someone’s life, but then I realized that is the point and it is aggressive - that’s why we should care.  I think it was very effective, yes.  I think maybe a little more of an explanation post quiz could help.   "
student_158,"I didn't know simple choices such as a meal could so drastically impact another person's life. It made me feel more aware, especially after picking a petrol car as a means of transport as that was my most impactful choice. I believe it was as it truly puts a sensible number on your actions and the impacts they have. I think a longer quiz with more options and questions could truly give some people insights into their lifestyle choices and how they affect others that they will never interact with or see.  "
student_159,"My immediate thoughts are how alarming simple choice that are made (mostly) daily can impacts someone else's timeline. This quiz does not sit very well with me as it might be hard to change some of these choices just by myself. Yes this quiz was definitely an effective way to communicate this issue as the simple number of how many hours were taken off of someone's life has really stuck with me. To be improved, I would be interested in researching more on this topic and using the article and quiz as a starting point.  "
student_160,I think that conveying information about toxicity and the usefulness of substances via quiz is a great way to encourage people to closely read and attempt to understand the information. After reading the information and taking the quiz I felt like my knowledge had been expanded on and reinforced. My suggestions for improvement are formatting the quiz in an interactive format where individuals can click on the answer they believe to be correct and then receive feedback on their response.  
student_161,This quiz brought to my attention the effects of climate that also affect other people. I think it was an effective way to communicate the issue. I think that the flight could be from the location that your computer is as opposed from a random location to a random location.  
student_162,"It made me sad. I chose the options that I would realistically do in everyday life and it's sad that I contribute heavily to climate issues. I think this calculator was good for recognizing what I could improve in my life. I think it was effective, It was quick and straight forward which is what people need to hear just the raw truth. "
student_163,I think that this quiz gives me a lot of perspective on my own life and how some of my choices impact the rest or the world. It makes me realize that I should make some more sustainable choices. It was definitely effective because it put it into perspective the negative repercussions of my lifestyle. It could have more questions.  
student_164,"Food: Chicken breast is the 3rd best optionTransport: Train is the 3rd best optionFlight: London-New York is the 4th best option It made me feel guilty. Yes, this quiz was effective in communicating this issue. I could improve my protein choices and transportation choices. "
student_165,"It made me rethink my choices and how they impact the environment.   I dont think it is an effective way to communicate the issue because the choices of food were very limited to part of dished such as cheese or lamb or tune, it would be better if you stated food items such as hamburger or salad or grilled cucumber. and for the flights it is very hard to make an acurate choice of which one you would pick. I think all of this adds up as something we cant think about how we impact the world its more of these options that were there would impact the world. so it doesnt really make me reflect on my daily choices. what could be improved are more specificaly daily things we do that impact. such as charging your phone or using your laptop or pc. something that a normal person wouldnt think impact the world on a large scale. but this message is very hard to pass through and make people actualy reflect and reconcider "
student_166,Seeing how my actions and decisions for myself negatively affect someone else's life made me realize i should start to be more aware of my actions.  Yes this is an effective way because seeing how your actions impact someone else's may changes someones mindset I feel like the flight question should be more relative for people because there was only one option in there that i would fly 
student_168,This made me feel really guilty because I know for a fact that even though I took 13.54 hours off someones life it could've been more had I chosen different options. This was an effective way to communicate issues due to how much it shocks you and how bad you feel after. It really puts attention on issues that we need to know about.  
student_169,I thought it was interesting that it calculates the percentage of someones life taken just by the choices you make  2. it made me feel sad for whoever would die but at the same time neutral because I wont know the person and its not realistic  3.yes it was an easy quiz fun questions with great information learned  4.the website and the questions i thought it was weird you drag the box down to asnwer question  5. 
student_170,"It made me feel sad that my own choices took time off of someone else's life. I didn't even consider this as a possibility, that my own choices could hurt someone that much. Even though it was obviously not on purpose, it still hurt me to see this. It was shocking but a very quick and effective way for me to understand how my choices impact others. I think the shock factor is the most important part of this quiz, since it really makes you think.  "
student_171,"I think it's a really weird concept because you're never just getting something from one place, you're always getting it from someone who got the materials from someone on and it's such a big confusing cycle for just one item. This honestly makes me feel sad because people have become so materialistic to the point where even after reading this, I bet some people wouldn't even care about the process, as long as they get what they need. I think the best way to really communicate this phenomenon is to just promote smaller businesses who are genuinely giving out good quality, homemade products that you can genuinely trust. I think in general, large productions should all be improved especially when some bigger companies are known to use child labor just to get their materials out. Overall, it's a very strange situation and its weird how many different places something will go to before you have it. "
student_172,"My choices took 16.72 hours off of someones life, thats really scary to think about but these are choices that i probably will continue to make. I would maybe choose public transport instead of a car "
student_173,This made me feel sad and aware because the statistic I was given that the steak I eat for dinner cuts 17 hours off the life of others due to the effects it has on climate change. I think it is a very eye opening quiz and results which was effective in communicating the effects and har. I think a little more detail to how it is cutting 17 hours off of lives of others would be an improvement that could be made. 
student_174,"I thought it was interesting to know how different choices affect people. Eating and transportation decisions are very important. The quiz made me feel bad about my like decisions as I took about an hour off someones life. Yes it was, some ways to improve was also very helpful. More questions could help the survey be more accurate.  "
student_175,"I think because I didn't put in an answer for the last question my answer wasn't as bad but if I were it would definitely have a bigger impact on me. I am only saying this because I got 42 minutes off someone's life. Honestly I think this was good to show people the impact they have on others, and since it was a quick three questions it didn't impact any of my time. I think the impact that flying has on people and the environment is insane and if anything were to be improved it should be the affect airplanes have on the planet.  "
student_176,I took almost 40 hours off of someone's life which made me feel a little upset because I didn't think that I was that bad. I think it was but the simplicity of it kind of makes the results not as 100% believable.  I have to eat better foods and be resourceful in transportation.  
student_177,"1.) I liked it, it made me think a bit more about the consequences and benefits of my choices, weighing them against each other, and thinking of possible solutions to it. 2.) Well I learned that I don't make the worst choices in terms of travel, but not the best either. 3.) Yes it is, directly saying you took time off of someone else's life due to climate change makes it feel like a lot more of an impact. 4.) My food choice was eggs which I think is fine, I should probably take a train or bus instead of an electric car, and I should probably pick a different airline connection then London-New York. "
student_180,This quiz made me feel like although my life choices are not much different than my peers it might be best to not compare myself to others and rather focus on what I can do to reduce my ecological footprint. I think this was an effected way to communicate the issue as it gives you real facts and data. I can try to use public transportation and eat less meat to reduce my footprint.  
student_181,"It made me feel more aware about the environmental impacts of my choices, but also made me confused about how some of my choices have such a high impact. I think this was an effective way to communicate the issue, but I feel like it could provide more explanation on the downsides to each option. "
student_182,"The response I got was ""Your choices took 40.2 minutes off someone else's life due to negative impacts of climate change"".  This does not make me feel horrible about my choices because I try and be mindful of the decisions I make but it also doesnt make me feel great.  I think I could try and drive less.  "
student_183,It made me feel guilty for the decisions I make. It also made me reevaluate how I can do better for the world around me. I think this is a very effective way to communicate this issue because it's plain and simple. If a picture of the person or thing your killing was on the screen when getting results.  
student_184,I thought that the quiz was definitely an interesting and effective way to make me confront the consequences of my actions and the impact that they have on the environment and other people. I think that tools like this that make those of us who don't really have to think about the things we do everyday (like ordering food or taking a trip) really examine our choices serve an important purpose. 
student_185,"Food: Chicken breast is the 3rd best optionTransport: Electric Car is the 4th best optionFlight: London-New York is the 4th best optionYour choices took 16.24 hours off someone else's life due to negative impacts of climate change. This person likely resides in South Asia or Sub-Saharan Africa   Knowing that I picked relatively good options, and still took 16 hours off of someone's life is a terrible realization to make. The flight, I did choose pretty randomly thinking that it would be a close flight and not knowing much else, but it is a scary thought to have.    This was an effective way to communicate because it really put into prospective how my first world choices affect others live in real time.  I would change my choices in retrospect. I would improve what I could to save a life. "
student_186,"1. I think that it was a little eye opening to know that the decisons that I think are positive for the environment are still negatively effecting someones life because of my consumption, it's not the absolute worst, but still not great.2. I think it was an effective way to communicate this issue 3. I also think that the questions could be a little more specific and relevent to everyday life, how many times does a person eat out a week, or fly from nyc to London. What about everyday dinner options or driving to the grocery store. "
student_187,I don't think this quiz is a proper judgement at all. I don't do long flights so I picked a random one. I do think it is cool that we have a way to guesstimate and inform people on decision in a quick quiz. more questions and more reasonable questions that we do daily.  
student_188,"Assuming this assignment is regarding the VizHub health data website, I feel this is a very useful and educational resource to help people like us, in first world countries, understand how disease can differ and affect countries that aren't the US. I do feel it is an effective way to communicate the issue of EID's, as it showcases how developing countries can be facing entirely different problems health wise than some place like America. I think what could be improved is more explanation on terms like DALY, it seems that this website could only be fully useful to somebody well-versed in healthcare speak, which is not the majority of people. I had to look up various terms included in this website as I did not know what they were. But it 100% put in perspective how different places deal with health issues differently in the world.  "
student_189,"I think it's interesting how decisions I made with only two to three seconds of thought has over 13 hours off of someone else's life. I think me and most of the people in this room are very privileged in the fact that we don't think about these things often because we are in a position where we don't need to. It made me feel shocked, but also not surprised because I sort of already knew that decisions we make in general have impact. I think this was effective but also was sort of just an attention grabber without adding much other additional explanations and such.  "
student_190,"I chose the first best options for two of the questions, however, I still took off 6 hours of someones life in areas like regions of Africa. This was a highly highly effective way to communicate the implications of our actions as the result of the quiz shocked me. I think a way this could be improved is a list of results for the best things that people could do if they chose the last or closer to worst options on their questions so that they can change their actions in the future.  "
student_191,"It was an alarming result. It forced me to think about everyday decisions and how big of an impact they actually have. People tend to move through their life, making these constant decisions and not realizing how much they can affect someone. Yes, it was an effective way to communicate these issues because it addresses things we choice to do every day and showed us real statics of its impacts. What could be improved would be showing better options for these decisions and showing why certain decisions are worse than other (giving more facts). "
student_192,"The quiz was interesting because it puts the individual in the place of being a killer. Often people (even as I write this I'm referring to ""people"" and ""individuals"" rather than myself) are able to become desensitized to issues because it is impersonal- they are not the problem, the system is. But, looking at my decisions, I see I am a part of the problem. It is not societies fault, I am society, therefore it is my fault. This comes with issues as the blame can be placed on lower-class individuals for not making change, while not holding companies and system structures responsible, but it does input a sense of responsibility for the world around me. I think this is an effective way to communicate the issue, yet it does ignore how the systems in the world and wealthier people without empathy are able to bypass this issue. "
student_193,I was surprised that my decisions on the meat i eat can effect someone else's life. It makes me think about all the other decisions i make that could effect someone else's life. yes it was effective because you can know how your decisons effect people ask more indepth questions  
student_194,"This quiz showed me that my consumption patterns are not sustainable. Although my choices only took 16 hours off of somebody's life, that life is directly affected by the choices that people make with larger incomes. This made me feel bad, because I don't want my choices to negatively affect another human being or animals. I do think that it was an effective way to communicate the issue because you're choosing the options that are most similar to your lifestyle. I think that I was confused on the flight connections, perhaps a more relative question. "
student_195,How did it make you feel? I feel as though it presents the information in a way that creates an emotional effect on the reader compelling them to care for the issue. Was it an effective way to communicate this issue? I believe this was a highly effective way to communicate the issue. He touched on personal issues as well as relatable content for everyday people. What could be improved?  I think this could be improved with a few other photographs and or diagrams.    
student_196,I am very surprised by the outcome of my quiz. I am shocked that through my choices I took 14.05 hours of someones life. This is very effective because it is a personalized towards how I live my life. I don't think anything needs to be improved. 
student_197,It made me feel so bad.  Seeing how much time MY choices made on someone else’s life was bizarre.  Definitely makes you think about how you can change your ways to be more sustainable to help not only your future but others. 
student_198,"The quiz slapped me in a face, being a very effective reality check. I think it was an effective way to communicate this issue because it puts the choices you make into perspective since it's bluntly telling you that your actions could be taking hours off of an innocents persons life, which no one wants to do if they can help it. What could be improved is more evidence/sources to back up how and why the impacts of your choices are so bad because added context is always important to help people retain why their choices are so unsustainable.   "
student_199,"I think that it's very easy for people to ignore how impactful our decisions have on our environment, regardless of how small we think they actually are.   I honestly felt a little guilty because there are things I could probably do in order to reduce my own carbon footprint.   I think it was an effective way to communicate this due to how straight to the point the issue was.   I think a more constant education on our effects is needed. Everyone is very ignorant about their impact it feels like we all forgot about our impact as soon as we became adults. "
student_200,"How did it make you feel? Really bad knowing I took 7-8 hours off someones life. Was it an effective way to communicate this issue? Yes it defiantly opened my eyes to how my travel effects peoples daily lives. What could be improved? I could choose options with less of a carbon footprint to better stop the spread of pollution world wide, and the impact Im having on it. "
student_202,"After completing the quiz, I was shocked to see how much of an impact my small choices made in regard to the health of someone else. It made me feel very selfish and upset about the choices I make on a day-to-day basis. I believe this was an extremely effective way to communicate the issue, as now I feel more aware of my decisions.  "
student_203,I chose either the first or second best option causing to only take off 12.84 hours off another life making me feel like I'm not doing the worst things possible and my choices are better then what I thought they would be. I feel this is an effective way to communicate because even picking some of the best issues there is still a consequence to your actions and I don't know how it could be improved to be better. 
student_204,This quiz made me feel guilty for the choices I have made in the past knowing the negative affects it had on someone else.  I think it was a very effective way to communicate this issue.  I would improve what types of foods I am consuming as well as my mode of transportation so that they are both more sustainable.  
student_205,"It was so weird, mine takes 16 hours off someones life. I never thought about how basic things like that could affect the environment so much. It for sure opened my eyes and was very effective. "
student_206,"Doing the quiz, I thought I had chosen the most environmentally friendly decisions. However, seeing that I had taken 13.57 hours off of someone's life in Asia makes me sad. This was a very effective way to communicate this issue, as it tells me my actions impact others' lives. I think that if there were more questions (larger sample size), that were related to my day to day actions, it would be more impactful.  "
student_208,"While taking this quiz I was a little confused on what the point was, but when I got to the end I realized it was how much our everyday choices impact other peoples lives.  This made me feel sad. I would say that I am a very lucky person where I am able to basically choose whatever option I wanted. In my everyday life I would also say that I usually don't think about how other people would be effected by these types of decisions.  An effective way to communicate this message is by saying that your everyday life choices impact other people in the world in ways you wouldn't normally think about.  What could be improved is the way I go about making desions in my life. Thinking about the background of my choices and what they will do to the future of our world.     "
student_209,The quiz result was a little bit shocking because I've never seem environmental impact depicted in terms of how many hours your choices take off of another person's life. I do think that this is an effective way to communicate this issue because it gives you a new perspective on the impacts of your choices. I think that we should always try to consider the impact of our choices when choosing things that could affect others or the environment and I think that this quiz is a good way to show that every choice directly impacts someone else.  
student_210,I feel awful. It's vegan time.  It's extremely blunt and I wish there was further explanation as to why my choices were the worst.  I'd like some data. 
student_211,This quiz made me feel sad that my choices took 16 hours off somebodies life due to climate change. This quiz made me aware on how our choices affect the environment. I would choose the best options next time. 
student_212,It was interesting to see the direct statistical results of my choices. This is something the world should consider when they make decisions. It was a simple and quick way to communicate an issue to the public. What could be improved is having more options.  
student_214,https://ziamehrabi.medium.com/calculate-the-human-impact-of-your-everyday-decisions-6a65d63efec9 It's kinda crazy that those simple choices can take that much off someones life. It made me feel like a little weird cause I do not think of my choices and it affects someone else's life. I could improve my choice by being more concerned. 
student_215,It was okay. It made me feel upset because i have been living in ignorance of my environmental impact. I don't know if it was the best effective way but it definitely made me understand my impact. They should ask more questions about family size.  
student_216,"Give your thoughts on this. How did it make you feel? This made me feel extremely horrible. I did not know eating a chicken breast and driving a car was sop impactful. I feel like actually so bad after seeing the results of this. Was it an effective way to communicate this issue? Yes, illustrating the effects of this really made me want to change my lifestyle and it was defiantly effective.  What could be improved? I could improve my diet and way of transportation in order to make a change.  "
student_217,"The bad thing is that I know that my choices were bad i just tried to be realistic. I always bus if i can but sometime there are time restraints. It made me feel awful. It really puts it into perspective about how impactful my life is for other people. It is really not good and makes me want to change. I think it was an effective way, i really liked it. It would be great to know how this is happening. I like it!  "
student_218,it made me change my perspective on things such as the choices I make in life and how it can effect other peoples lives wether that's in a good or bad way. maybe a change in lifestyle can be improved to help better other people and myself.  
student_219,"I feel really guilty and entitled after taking the quiz. It said I took 14hrs off of someones life. I feel bad and I feel like I need to make a change. I feel sad that my choices are impacting someone elses life. I am going to eat out less, use more reusable ways of transport, and think before i act. "
student_220,I liked how it was short because the longer it was I would click off. It made me feel like I could do something to make a change in this world that is so simple like picking the food and the transporation I take and eat. This quiz was an effective way to communicate this because it was short and simple. I think more questions and tell us why this equals to so many hours and thats the only thing that could be improved 
student_221,I was very surprised by this and it made me feel bad.  The way that they word the results to tell you how much time you are taking off someone else's life is very concerning.  I think that it is a very effective way to communicate the issue and it will make me consider my others options.  I think if more questions are asked it would make an even bigger impact 
student_222,"Made me look at my environmental footprint a lot differently rather than effecting the whole world it became more personal and even gave you a place where it would effect someones life. It was very effective, and it doesn't need to be improved. "
student_223,"I was a little disappointed in my results considering my choices. I am a vegetarian and have a plug in hybrid car and so I thought at least one of my choices would contribute to helping the climate crisis. However, this was not the case. I think that choosing my flights wisely could greatly improve my contribution to the environment and someone's life.  "
student_224,It made me feel guilt. I think this gets the point across about how our actions impact other peoples lives. I do believe that guilting people about their choices is not necessarily the best way about changes peoples choices. Most of the time the choices you made are ones you have to make. It does not exactly get to the root of the problem. 
student_225,This made me feel really bad and selfish. This was an incredibly effective way of communicating the issue because it really broke it down to a small scale that was understandable based on a single person. The last question didn't really make sense and it wasn't as much of a day-to-day decision as the other two questions.  
student_227,"This made me feel indifferent. his was quite effective at communicating an issue, however I just don't think that my single choice matters. A way to improve this would be to use a more visual presentation. "
student_228,"Food: Eggs is the 2nd best optionTransport: Bus is the 2nd best optionFlight: London-New York is the 4th best option this made me think I am not as impactful as other options, but this also made me guilty because I don't want to cause harm to the world that is already having a lot of pollution. An effective way to communicate this is by being more educated on how to find more environmental friends and a sustainable way to get your food and to transport it. My flight could be improved and my food source. "
student_229,It made me realize even more the true impact I have on other people and how it's very real and very dangerous. I think it was effective because you can see the actual numbers that your actions cause rather than just a random estimate or general idea.  
student_230,This made me concerned and realize how much three little decisions can make such a big impact. I think asking people these questions and showing how many hours or people this negatively impacts will hit them and make them realize the reactions and consiquences of their actions. being more empathetic and less self concerned will help me and hopefully I can impact others to show how detrimental the way someone eats and travels is. 
student_231,"This quiz made me realize that I should be more careful with how I go about my everyday life. When looking at some of the choices, especially being a little hungry, I chose steak, which turned out to be the worst option. I think it's essential to research and find out what we can change in our everyday lives to help better the environment and not make the worst decisions.  An effective way to communicate this issue is genuinely through word of mouth. I think discussing this issue with peers, whether in person or through the media, can help get the word out to at least one person who is willing to do more to make a change.  Our carbon footprint, gas emissions, and resource and energy use can be improved.  "
student_232,"It definitely did not make me feel good to know that my choices are harming other peoples' health. I do not want that. I do not think that anyone wants that. It is definitely an effective way to communicate the issue of the impact of overconsumption in higher income nations on less economically developed nations. It is just hard not to take the quiz and feel helpless. I don't even think that the choices I made were that bad, and I don't even know what I could do differently. "
student_233,I was really surprised. I got 13 years off someone else's life. I thought that my everyday choices were sustainable which was the main reason I was so surprised at the result. It made me feel like I should change some of my habits. I think an effective way to communicate this issue would be to create articles and post them to journals but also to social media to reach a larger group of people and inform them of the impact of their choices. I think I could drive less. 
student_234,"This made me feel a bit silly for wanting to drive and eat chicken, I didn't realize just these somewhat small choices took 16 hours off someone's life.  An effective way to communicate this issue is to talk more about driving or eating less meat, switching to vegan might be the move.  I could improved my impacts my taking public transport and being vegan.  "
student_235,"How did it make you feel? - It made me feel extremely aware and conscious of my actions. It doesn't make anyone feel good I don't think. Was it an effective way to communicate this issue? - Yes, I think this abrupt, straight-forward way of communicating people's individual impacts on the environment and others is effective. What could be improved? - I think making conscious decisions every day as an individual can improve a little. "
student_236,"Made me feel like I could do more to stop my carbon footprint from getting too big It was an affective way as it was quick and easy and told me straight up facts on what was wrong with what I chose. The connecting flight one was a little confusing, so just making it easier to understand.  "
student_237," Taking this quiz made me think differently about the effects of my everyday actions. It made me realize how large of an impact every action makes, yet people rarely consider these effects when making their choice. While taking 16 hours off of someone's life may seem like a miniscule difference, it becomes significant when many people are doing these same actions. This was definitely an effective way to communicate this issue.  The only suggestion I have would be to adjust the impact to a larger scope and incorporate the actions of other people. 16 hours off of 1 life does not seem like a lot, but the combined impact of everyone's actions is much worse, and should be shown in the quiz.   "
student_238,This opened up my eyes to how my decisons can affect someone else without me even knowing. An effective way to communicate this issue is to make it more nationally known that these issues are out there and that even a simple decison like what you are gonna eat can effect people. Public knowledge of these problems could be improved that way everyone knows that what they do has an effect on someone. 
student_239,I took too much time from someone else I wanted to make better environmental choices Yes it was Give better scenarios for each option 
student_240,"I never thought about the consequences of these choices as taking time off of other's lives. It was a bit surprising when the statistic showed up saying these choices could take 17 hours off of someone's life. This quiz was effective, I chose what I normally would and then it showed the distant effects.  Our choices effect others, even if it is minimal and distant, but it adds up over the population and throughout time. So, it is important that we advocate for these issues.  "
student_241,This frightened me because I didn't know that my day to day choices actually impacted people's life spans. It made me feel guilty but disappointed because sustainable options don't seem to be accessible. This is an effective way to communicate this issue because it makes people who take the questionnaire more conscious of their ecological footprint. I think education about and access to more sustainable options need to be improved.  
student_242,"I liked the quiz overall because I think it makes us confront the privilege we have in the choices we have available and their relitvely low direct effect on us. It made me feel disheartened to see the effects of such simple choices on other people because there is no real way to prevent it in our industrialized world sometimes. For example, I live in a very rural area without bike lanes and side walks so I have to take cars to get around a large majority of the time. I think this was a good way to communicate the issue on an elementary level to get across the basic understanding. I think it could be improved by giving a more descriptive explanation of what specifically our actions cause. "
student_243,"It made me feel like I could be doing so much more to prevent my carbon footprint, and it made me feel slightly disappointed in the continuous decisions I have made for my own convenience.  I think this was a very effective way to communicate this issue, it is quick and easily describes how much of an impact one's carbon footprint can make. I do not think there is a need to improve anything.  "
student_244,This made me feel like I need to start make a change in my lifestyle because if I am taking 13 hours off someones life it makes me sad. A good way to communicate this issue is through working with restaurants and or finding other more efficient transportation options. An effective way to improve this issue is by choosing different options when trying to go places and eating the protein that has the least effect on the environment.    
student_245,"After taking this quiz I realized I don't know how affective my decisions can be on someone else's life and it made me more aware.  Yes, I think so it gave enough detail on what my choices impacted and surprised me easily.  I think being more aware personally but also giving people the opportunity to learn about what their impact may be and how it may affect them and others including the environment.  "
student_246,"Honestly, the result of this quiz was shocking to me. The fact that my decisions took time off of someone else's life made me understand the true impact of my decisions. I am now aware of the problems I can cause due to high consumption and the difference I can make if I make sustainable decisions. The way that this was calculated honestly confused me, but I'm glad I took the quiz. "
student_247,This quiz make me feel sad that I took of 14.1 hours off someone else's life. I thought this quiz was a great way to communicate this issue because it makes it personal to the reader. I though this could be improved by having more options so we can have a more exact estimate.  
student_249,I think the aim of the quiz was to try to gain empathy for the people you affect but I think it mostly made me feel a sense of guilt although my choices weren't bad. I think it was slightly effective although there definitely would be better ways to spread awareness on this issue. I think the question about the flight should be written better but the ending question about whether I would change was interesting and impactful. 
student_250,"How did it make you feel? I was shown to take away 17 hours away from someones life, I was suprised at this and did not think everday choices would have a big impact on other peoples life. this doesnt make me feel good and In would reconsider my choices. Was it an effective way to communicate this issue? Yes, because it allowed us to choice  the options without seing the impacts, and then providing us knowledge after we found out the consequence. What could be improved? There could be more options that allow for more sustainable options and allow for change.  "
student_251,"The quiz was very interesting. I chose two of the worst options, which correlated with a greater impact. Ordinarily, I would not have considered the impacts of my choices in terms of another person's life, so I feel the quiz was very eye-opening and certainly an effective way to communicate the impacts of our choices. In the future, I will be more likely to choose options that correlate with lesser human impacts. I don't think the quiz needs to be improved; it was easy and effective.  "
student_252,It is really interesting to see how the choices we make daily have such a real effect on the world. I think an effective way to communicate this to the masses is to start campaigns to inform people about the dangers of over-consuming. 
student_253,It is an extremely wild perspective to come to terms with the fact the I am privileged enough to do things and not be taught the full consequences of my actions. I think that we need to improve the general education relating to this topic.  
student_254,It didn't make me feel any different since I already knew my impact on this earth would not be positive. I think that this was a fun way to communicate this issue. I wouldn't put a starving child's face as the first thing you see to get people to take the quiz and I would also add other things people do that contribute to this issue that arent as obvious as traveling. 
student_256,"Human life is such a hard-to-grasp concept, but It's also an effective measure of atrocity. If we were directly asked to take 13 hours off of someone else's life one would assume you would not do it. The exercise quantifies what is often not able to be quantified. Sure there are endless statistics about the value of life and the value of the enviorment, but it's not often perceptible.    "
student_257,Made me feel weird thinking these three options took someone else 17 hours to accomplish. I think it was effective because it puts certain luxuries people have in a new perspective. To improve this people could work for their food more or maybe travel less. 
student_258,Makes me feel pretty horrible about what i'm doing and my carbon footprint decisions.   Yes.   Using less petrol modes of transportation.   
student_259,This made me feel fortunate knowing I have these luxuries but know I should be more mindful. I think this was an effective way to communicate this issue. I think that could be improved is more of a diverse understanding on the topic. 
student_260,"I think this calculator is interesting to make people aware of some of their choices. I do not think many people often worry about how their life is affecting someone else's, especially not someone so far away. It made me think about my daily impacts on people in third world countries/countries really suffering from climate change. It made me sad to think there small choices in my life could have such a big negative impact on someone else's life. I think things like these that make people more aware of their impacts on the world. More daily education on choices and environmental impact would help as some people are just blissfully unaware. Giving more daily option could make things seem more real such as how often do you shower, how often do you eat such foods, how often do you travel, etc.  "
student_261,Makes me feel pretty horrible about my carbon footprint actions.   Yes this was an effective way to communicate this issue.   I could not use petrol cars as a start because I feel like thats the most important to pollution and I also could just think about my carbon footprint before my actions 
student_262,I am surprised that I took 16 hours off someone's life by making choices that I do everyday. I was defiantly a little taken aback. It would be helpful to have a list of what options were the best choices and also to have miles represented as well as KM! 
student_263,"This made me feel bad in a way because taking hours out of people's lives in general isn't something I believe is positive.    There are multiple ways of communicating this issue, including speaking to the world or doing things to help with life's issues. You can even do research and make a blog or a post about trying to take action for the betterment of not just your life but everyone else.   A lot can be improved in life, like keeping the place cleaner and better or even more cared for. "
student_264,This was a wake-up call that I think a lot of the developed world needs to hear about. The choices I made were pretty good because I make sure that I am aware of how my actions will impact the planet but I think there is a lot of ignorance on this topic. 
student_265,"I did not agree with this quiz. There are so many factors in play and they simplify it too much making it look like if you don't choose to eat chickpeas you are taking someones like without acknowledging factors such as how much energy you use is a day or where the food you eat is sourced. It can be improved by adding more questions an also instead of framing it to look like you are killing someone, show multiple effects of what can result from your choices. "
student_266,I didn't realize how big of an impact my food and transportation options had on other people. It makes me feel bad and makes me want to change some of my choices. I feel that this quiz is a good way to get this point across. I could try to eat food that has less of an impact and use more sustainable transportation options.
