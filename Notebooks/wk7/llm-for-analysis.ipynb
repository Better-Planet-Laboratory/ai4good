While it is hard to assess directly from the paper,  earlier on in the year we did run an advocacy campaign which included a brief survey in which people had to pick some food items, travel options and from that were told how many minutes they would take from another persons life due to the climate change impacts of those consumption choices. https://ziamehrabi.medium.com/calculate-the-human-impact-of-your-everyday-decisions-6a65d63efec9.

Compare outputs of the last excercise to either an extractive (e.g. BERTSUM) or abstractive summarization model (e.g. like BART, T5) run over the whole dataset (hint: first do summaries of the individual responses, then concatenate and do a summary of the result) Do the take-homes differ from your simple approach of sampling different responses? If so how?\n",
