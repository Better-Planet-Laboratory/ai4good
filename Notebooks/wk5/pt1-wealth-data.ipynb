    "# Part 1: Pulling and Visualizing Wealth Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Despite decades of declining poverty rates, an estimated 8.4% of the global population remains in extreme poverty as of 2019, and progress has slowed in recent years [1]. But data on poverty remain surprisingly sparse, hampering efforts at monitoring local progress, targeting aid to those who need it, and evaluating the effectiveness of antipoverty programs [2]. Previous works [3,4] have demonstrated using computer vision on satellite images and street-level images to predict economic livelihood.\" [5]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will pull a 2021 benchmark dataset from the Stanford Sustainability and AI Lab called \"SustainBench\". This dataset contains a variety of datasets related to sustainability, including datasets related to poverty and wealth mapping. More info on it can be found on the [project website](https://sustainlab-group.github.io/sustainbench/), the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sustainlab-group/sustainbench), or the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04724). The data comes from surveys collected by the [Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program](https://dhsprogram.com/) from USAID (RIP üò¢). Nationally represenative surveys are conducted every few years in dozens of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) around the world. Surveyors will go out to urban neigborhoods or rural communities and survey a few dozen random households within that \"cluster\". The anonymized household level data is geotagged with the coordinates of the cluster with a jitter to further protect privacy. The jitter is within a 2km radius for urban clusters, and a 5km radius for rural clusters. We will focus on Task 1A from SustainBench, mapping wealth and poverty spatially. SustainBench has made our lives easier by collating this data for 80k+ clusters and making it publicly avaiable, but you can request the original and latest household-level data directly from the [DHS on their website](https://dhsprogram.com/data/available-datasets.cfm), it takes just a couple of days to get approved.\n",

    "In subsequent notebooks, we then will pull in 3 geospatial foundation models that use three different architectures:\n",
    "1. [CLAY](https://madewithclay.org/) (pre-trained with a masked autoencoder)\n",
    "2. [SatCLIP](https://github.com/microsoft/satclip) (pre-trained with contrastive learning)\n",
    "3. [MOSAIKS](https://www.mosaiks.org/) (random convolutional features)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use these models to extract features from the poverty and wealth mapping dataset, and then train a linear classifier on top of these features to predict the poverty and wealth labels. We will then evaluate the performance of each model on the test set.\n",
