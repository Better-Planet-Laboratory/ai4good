The documentation is [here](https://torchgeo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the associated publication from 2021 [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08872). It is an active community and well maintained repository that is super useful especially for pulling in existing models and working with satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. \n\n\nIn this notebook, we'll be using a benchmark dataset called \"EuroSAT\" that includes 27,000 satellite image patches from Sentinel-2 over Europe along with a label about what the image is of. This is a more complex dataset, and so we'll need a deeper neural network to classify the images. We'll create a commonly-used type of convolutional neural network (CNN) used for image classifcation, [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), and compare the performance of randomly initialized weights versus pretrained weights.\n\n**Learning Outcomes**:\n- Learn the basics of the TorchGeo API\n- Learn an API for working with satellite imagery\n- Train a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification\n- Learn to pull pretrained weights for a model and compare performance","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Environment Setup\n\nBefore we start, we'll definitely want to use GPUs for this task since the dataset and the neural network are much larger than we were using before.

This pales compared to 1.76 trillion parameters in GPT-4 (about 10^5 times smaller), but we're not OpenAI, everyone starts somewhere.\n\nWe'll mostly be training in this notebook, so go ahead and use the higher power P100 GPU.

What applications could this be used for that relate to the [UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)? Write out your answer.\n\n## Bonus Challenge #1: Plotting Loss per Epoch\nA common practice in ML is to report your loss over time as you train and validate your model with each epoch. For this challenge, implement code that records the training and validation loss after each epoch and then plot it. \n\n## Bonus Challenge #2: F1 Score\nThe [F1 score](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/f1-score-in-machine-learning/) is a more nuanced metric than accuracy that takes into account class imbalances. Implement the reporting of the F1 score of your model alongside the accuracy when evaluating the model on validation or test data.\n\n## Bonus Challenge #3: Using a TPU\nDo whatever code adaptations are necessary to run this code on the TPU VM v3-8 available in Kaggle. Track the changes you make, and then report on how this affects training speed. \n\n## Bonus Challenge #4: Adding Data Augmentation\nThe code below adds in some data augmentations before running the data through the model. This is a technique that is often used to get the most out of your training data and ensure that the representations learned by the model are as general as possible. For this challenge, use the code below as a guide to add data augmentations to the training pipeline. Feel free to use whatever data augmentations you'd like, just provide a justification as to why you used those. Compare how this affects your accuracy on the validation and test data. Reflect on why you are seeing the results you are. Below is a code chunk that should help you as a starting point:\n```{python}\ntransform = transforms.Compose([\n    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),  # Randomly flip the image horizontally\n    transforms.RandomVerticalFlip(p=0.5),  # Randomly flip the image vertically\n    transforms.Resize((224, 224))  # Resizes the images to 224x224\n])\n\ncustom_transform = CustomTransform(transform)\n```\n\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
